# Geometric Modeling System Framework 10

The Geometric Modeling System Framework 10 (GFX) is the next generation of open source geometric modeling and exchange framework. Based on the philosophy of the design of Geometric Modeling System (GEMS) version 6, 7 and 8, GFX continues its focus on the kernel data representations and algorithms for geometric modeling applications, e.g., Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and Compter-Aided Engineering (CAE).

Considering the full compatibility with various of operating systems and environments, GFX is built on top of the new standard of C++, as well as the corresponding standard template library. The core part of the framework is a template library, following the design philosophy of CGAL (https://www.cgal.org), rather than the previous versions of GEMS, which were built on ATL, MFC and G++ Framework.
